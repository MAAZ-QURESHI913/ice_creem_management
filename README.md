# Qureshi Ice Cream Ordering System

Welcome to the **Qureshi Ice Cream Ordering System**! üç¶

This is a simple Python script that allows users to order ice cream from a predefined menu. Users can view the list of available flavors and prices, place orders, and receive the total price to pay. The project is designed to help beginners practice their Python skills by working with:

- **Dictionaries** for storing menu items and their prices
- **Loops** for repeated user interactions
- **Conditional statements** for input validation

## Features

- Displays a menu of ice cream flavors and their respective prices.
- Accepts user orders for any number of items.
- Calculates the total bill based on the selected items.
- Provides feedback if the ordered item is not on the menu.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the `ice_cream_ordering.py` script using a Python interpreter (Python 3.6+ is recommended).
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to place your order.
4. The script will display the total price once you finish ordering.
